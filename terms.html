                    <p>The Client shall have the right to authorise a third person to give Instructions and/or
                        Orders to the Company or to handle any other matters related to this Agreement provided that
                        the client has notified the Company in advance and in writing, of exercising such a right
                        and that this person is approved by the Company as fulfilling all of the Company&rsquo;s
                        requirements.</p>

                    <p>The written notification for the termination of the authorization to a third party has to be
                        received by the Company in writing and with at least 5 days notice prior to the termination
                        date of authorization.</p>
                    <p>Unless the Company receives a written notification from the Client for the termination of a
                        third person&rsquo;s authorization, the Company will continue accepting instructions and/or
                        orders given by this person on the Client&rsquo;s behalf and the Client will recognise such
                        orders as valid and committing the Client.</p>


                    <p class="fw-bold text-uppercase color-brand policy-title">OPERATION TIME</p>
                    <p>The Company's trading operations are typically available from 21:00 on Sunday (GMT time) until
                        20:59 on Friday (GMT time). This means that trading activities, including placing orders,
                        executing trades, and accessing market information, can be conducted during this period.

                        It's important to note that there are exceptions to this trading schedule. Specifically, the
                        Company does not operate on the 25th of December (Christmas Day) and the 1st of January (New
                        Year's Day). On these days, trading activities may be temporarily suspended.

                        Clients should be aware of the Company's trading hours and any holiday or non-trading days when
                        planning their trading activities. It is recommended to refer to the specific trading schedule
                        provided by the Company or consult with their account manager for the most up-to-date
                        information on trading hours and holiday schedules.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-uppercase color-brand policy-title">MARGINS AND COLLATERAL PAYMENT</p>
                    <p>During the duration of a CFD (Contract for Difference) or FX (Foreign Exchange) position, the
                        Company has the right to review and modify the funding requirements or interest rates associated
                        with these instruments. This can be done at the Company's discretion, with or without prior
                        notice to the Client. The adjustments may occur in response to volatile market conditions or
                        other factors.

                        For spot positions held overnight, adjustments may be made to account for the costs associated
                        with carrying the position over to the next trading day. The specific details regarding these
                        adjustments, including the rates and calculations involved, can be found on the Company's
                        website.

                        It is important for clients to regularly review the information provided on the Company's
                        website and stay informed about any changes to funding requirements, interest rates, or
                        adjustments related to their CFD or FX positions.</p>
                    <p>When the Company effects or arranges a Transaction involving a CFD or FX, the Client should
                        note that, depending upon the nature of the Transaction, the Client may be liable to make
                        further payments when the Transaction fails to be completed or upon the earlier settlement
                        or closing out of the Client&rsquo;s position. The Client will be required to make further
                        variable payments by way of margin against the purchase price of the CFD or FX, instead of
                        paying (or receiving) the whole purchase (or sale) price immediately. The movement in the
                        market price of the Client&rsquo;s investment will affect the amount of margin payment the
                        Client will be required to make. The Company will monitor the Client&rsquo;s margin
                        requirements on a daily basis and shall inform the Client as soon as is reasonably
                        practicable of the amount of any margin payment required under this provision.</p>

                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, margin must be paid in cash. Cash margin is paid to the Company as
                    </p>
                    <p>Under the terms of the agreement, the Client agrees to make payment to the Company as requested,
                        in the form of margin. The amount of margin required may vary and is determined based on the
                        Rules of any relevant Market, if applicable, or at the Company's discretion. The purpose of
                        collecting margin is to safeguard the Company against potential losses or risks associated with
                        the present, future, or anticipated transactions conducted under the Agreement.

                        The specific amount of margin required and the frequency of payments will depend on various
                        factors, including the nature of the transactions and market conditions. It is important for the
                        Client to comply with these margin requirements to ensure the proper execution of the
                        transactions and to mitigate potential risks.

                        Agreement or any Applicable Regulations, the Company shall have a general lien on all funds
                        held by Company or its Associates or its nominees on the Client&rsquo;s behalf until the
                        satisfaction of the Client&rsquo;s obligations.</p>
                    <p>The Company shall have the right, in addition to any other rights the Company may have under
                        this Agreement, to close and/or limit the size of the Client&rsquo;s open positions (new or
                        Gross) and to refuse to establish new positions and or change trading conditions including
                        but not limited to interest, leverage, spreads, fees. Situations, where the Company may
                        exercise such rights, include, but are not limited to, where:</p>
                    <ol>

                        type, some or all positions are automatically closed at market price, until the point where
                        the client&rsquo;s margin level is above the Stop out level of the Client&rsquo;s account
                        type.</p>
                    <p>If the Client&rsquo;s combined exposure in one or more margin trades reaches a level which
                        &ndash; in case of adverse market development &ndash; may lead to a significant deficit not
                        covered by the Client&rsquo;s deposits and/or margin with the Company, the Company may in
                        its discretion</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a) increase the margin requirements and/or;</li>
                        <li>b) reduce the Client&rsquo;s exposure by closing one or more or all of the
                            Client&rsquo;s open positions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Furthermore, the Company is entitled in its reasonable opinion to determine that an emergency
                        or an exceptional market condition has occurred. Such conditions shall include but are not
                        limited to, the suspension or closure of any market or the abandonment or failure of any
                        event to which the Company relates its quote or the occurrence of an excessive movement in

                        anticipation of the occurrence of such a movement. In such cases, the Company may increase
                        its margin requirements, reduce the Client&rsquo;s exposure, close any or all of the
                        Client&rsquo;s open Margin Trades and/or suspend trading.</p>

                        &amp; ORDERS</p>
                    <p>Only the Client, or individuals previously identified in written communication to the Company as authorized representatives, may issue directives and place trades through the Online Trading System. Orders must be executed in accordance with the procedures detailed in this section.</p>
                    <p>Using their Login Details, the Client can initiate new trades through the Online Trading System, direct the closure of existing positions, or request alterations or removal of pending orders.</p>
                    <p>If the Company receives an Order through means other than the Online Trading System, it will input the order into the Online Trading System, when feasible, treating and processing it as though it originated directly from the system.</p>

                    <p>The Company has the right to trust and execute any Order without additional investigation. Any Orders placed using the Login Details, as outlined in this section, will be deemed as final and binding on the Client.</p>

                    <p>The Company is committed to processing all Orders from the Client exactly as they are provided. The onus of ensuring the accuracy of an Order rests with the Client. Every Order submitted to the Company by the Client serves as an unalterable directive for the Company to execute the Transaction in line with the Client’s specifications.</p>

                    <p>Should the Company perceive any Order as authentic, it will be regarded as a legitimate request from the Client. The Client bears the liability for any damages, claims, or costs sustained by the Company in the process of acting upon or attempting to act upon the Client's Orders.</p>
                    <p>The Company is not bound to assess or confirm any assumptions or statements made by the Client concerning the effect of a transaction on their current or aggregate positions with the Company. Annotations indicating that a transaction aims to close a portion or entirety of an open stance will not be factored in by the Company. All transactions will be categorized as either a purchase or a sale, regardless of its impact on initiating a new stance or terminating a current one. The onus is on the Client to consistently be updated about their positions.</p>


                    <p>Should the Client issue an Order to the Company that contravenes the terms of this Agreement, the Company reserves the unilateral right to execute such an Order to the extent it deems fit. In such instances, the Client relinquishes any right to retract any partially completed Order as a result.</p>

                    <p>Should the Client violate the stipulations of this Agreement, they will be held accountable for such breach and will be obligated to finalize the ensuing Transaction as outlined within the provisions of this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>Utilizing the Trading platform, the Client is authorized to issue the subsequent trading-related orders:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a) OPEN: to open a position;</li>
                        <li>b) CLOSE: to close an open position;</li>
                        <li>c) To add, remove, edit orders for Stop Loss, Take Profit, Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell
                            Limit, Sell Stop, Trailing Stop;</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Orders not specified previously are not permissible and will be instantaneously declined.</p>
<p>Spot positions that remain open will transition to the subsequent business day at business closure in the pertinent market, with the understanding that the Company reserves the right to terminate any open spot position.</p>
                    <p>Once a position is open or closed, it's finalized and cannot be altered or revoked.</p>
<p>Modifying or retracting Stop Loss, Take Profit, and Limit Orders is not permissible once the price achieves the designated threshold.</p>
<p>Orders are valid for execution, alteration, or removal exclusively during active trading hours. If not executed, they carry over to the subsequent trading session.</p>
<p>The duration of an Order remains valid based on its type and designated timeframe. Absent specific validity or expiration details, the Order remains indefinitely active.</p>
<p>Orders such as Stop Loss, Take Profit, Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Limit, and Sell Stop trigger for execution at the Client's set price upon the market's initial touch. Nonetheless, the Company may decline the Order's transmission or adjust the transaction's start or end price due to technical glitches in the trading platform, including instrument quote disruptions or other technical complications.</p>

                    <p>The Company may establish cut-off times for instructions or Orders which may be earlier than
                        the times established by the particular Market and/or clearinghouse involved in any
                        Transaction and the Client shall have no claims against the Company arising out of the fact
                        that an Order was not placed by the Client ahead of our cut-off time.</p>
                    <p>The Company shall have the right to change the Contract Specifications at any time depending
                        on the market situation. The Client agrees to check the full specifications of the CFD or FX
                        before placing any Order. The Company reserves the right to permit a change to the Account
                        Leverage at its discretion.</p>
                    <p>The level of Swap Rates may vary in size and change depending on the level of interest rates.
                        The Company reserves the right to change the level of Swap Rates and inform the Client about
                        it through the Online Trading System or by electronic means. From Friday to Monday swaps are
                        calculated once. From Wednesday to Thursday swaps are calculated in triple size. The company
                        may offer Swap-free accounts for religious purposes. Clients who can provide acceptable
                        proof of a need for Swap-free accounts will be granted this account type. Accounts that are
                        swap-free may hold a position open for a maximum of two weeks (14 days), before being
                        charged a commission on the open position. Commission on swap-free trades will be the
                        equivalent of $50 per lot traded. This commission will automatically be deducted from the
                        client&rsquo;s account following the 14ᵗʰ consecutive day of opened trades. The Company
                        reserves the right to change the client&rsquo;s account type from Swap-free to a standard
                        Swap bearing account at its discretion. Furthermore, if the Company deems trading behaviour
                        to be taking advantage of a swap-free account through interest rate arbitrage, the Company
                        reserves the right to retroactively charge swaps on all previously open positions.</p>
                    <p>The Client accepts that the transmitted orders may be executed by the Company&rsquo;s
                    <p> liquidity providers which may change from time to time.</p>
                   <p>The Company collaborates with multiple liquidity providers to ensure consistent trading liquidity. These providers, which may change over time, offer the Company the necessary liquidity for trade execution. The selection criteria for these providers include competitive pricing, market depth, reliability, and regulatory adherence. The Company actively monitors these partners to ensure optimal trading conditions for clients. However, in volatile market scenarios, the Company may not be able to execute Orders at the declared price due to rapid price shifts or trading restrictions. As a result, a Stop Loss Order may not always cap the client's losses as intended due to unpredictable market behavior.</p>

                    <p>The safety of your login data is of paramount importance, as it protects access to your accounts, personal information, financial assets, and other sensitive data. Here are some guidelines and tips to ensure the security of your login credentials:</p>

                    <p>The Client agrees to keep secret and confidential and not disclose to any person any part of
                        the Login Data other than an individual who has been expressly authorised to act on the
                        Client&rsquo;s behalf according to paragraph 6.</p>
                    <p>The Client shall not write down the Login Details. If the Client receives a written
                        notification of the Login Details, the Client must destroy said notification immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Client agrees to notify the Company immediately if the Client knows or reasonably suspect
                        that the Login Data has or may have been disclosed to any unauthorised person. The Company
                        will then take such reasonable steps to prevent any further use of such Login Data and will
                        issue the Client with replacement Login Data. The Client will be unable to place any Orders
                        until the Client has received replacement Login Data.</p>
                    <p>The Client agrees to co-operate with any investigation the Company may conduct into any
                        misuse or suspected misuse of the Login Data.</p>
                    <p>The Client accepts liability for all orders given through and under the Login Data and any
                        such orders received by the Company will be considered as placed by the Client. In cases
                        where a third person is assigned as an authorised representative to act on the
                        Client&rsquo;s behalf, the Client will be responsible for all orders given through and under
                        said representative&rsquo;s Login Data.</p>
                    <p>The Client acknowledges that the Company assumes no responsibility for any unauthorised access by
                        third parties to information, including electronic addresses, electronic communications, and
                        personal data, during their transmission between the Company or any other party, whether through
                        the internet or other network communication facilities, postal services, telephone, or any other
                        electronic means.</p>
